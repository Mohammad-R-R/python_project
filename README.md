# python_project
•	Introduction:
The idea of EasyApply is to have your dream job as fast as you can, without going through a long process and filling up many boring forms.
The user will register in EasyApply and when finishing the registration, he already passed half the way,  then will fill the rest of his resume with the education, experience adding with skills, and the rest on EasyApply.

The available jobs will appear on the user page he can search and apply to which ever jobs will match with the experience and skills he has and EasyApply will do the rest.

The project contains 7 HTML pages including their CSS (style sheets), responsive pages applied for some, and the AJAX will validate the password matching in spot.

Validation is available for password as the email do also, if the user not registered, he could register and use the website as he wants.

The back end done by Python language (MVC Django), it is linking the models’ classes using one to one relationship between the user and his CV, many to many relationships between the CV and the education 
and one to many between the cd and education, skills & experience.

The project is built within 2 days as frontend and 3 days as backend using the admin page for django and building the routes in urls, views and models files. And it is open for enhancements and updates.
